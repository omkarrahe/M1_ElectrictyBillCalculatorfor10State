In this Project 
First of all we have to take input from user that from  which state he belong
As This miniproject Electricity bill calculator is applicable for 10 State 
After this we call unit function and Suppose user has enter 4 Which is pre set as Gujrat
After this all work go in hand of function
Function will take various input from user such as Name of equipment how many hour he run how many similar equipment he have
And After this function return total unit consume in that month
THen Switch case come in picture After that switch case CAlculate the bill by the help of if else and Display final bill
The bill which we getting is here is 99.99 percent accurate in one condition if the proper timing and proper wattagwe of equipment is entered  by the user.

THe main Advantage of this is no such type of calculator is present which can able to calculate 10 State we can also expand it to All over India .

And I have tested it for each and every state the Electricity bill they are getting and our calculator is calculating is exact same.
